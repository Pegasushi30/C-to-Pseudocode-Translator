6)I didn't do the check undeclared variables in input text bonus
7)Nested Loop and Nested If statements are being checked so I did this bonus part
I have added example inputs from the VSE 351 project document into the file.
I've tried those inputs to test my yacc and lex.
I've made a makefile you can use it with "make". You can do "make clean".
You can simply write "./program input.txt" to run the project.
I've used the UBUNTU 20.04.6 LTS to run my code
I'm getting "12 shift/reduce" warning but I far as I've tested the code I can easily
do all the sample inputs.
